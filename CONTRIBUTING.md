- [issues](https://github.com/jc9108/expanse/issues)::
	- before opening a new issue, try searching existing issues first
	- when submitting a bug report::
		- make sure you are on the latest version of the app in case the bug has already been patched
		- explicitly state what version of the app you are using (find it on line 30 of your local `expanse/compose.prod.yaml`)
		- try to include as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the bug
	- please answer follow up questions, if any, in a timely manner
	- refrain from posting "+1" comments. use the thumbs reaction instead
- [PRs](https://github.com/jc9108/expanse/pulls)::
	- before working on a new PR, try searching existing issues and PRs first
	- when submitting a PR::
		- try to include as much detail as possible of what changes you are proposing
		- try to adhere to the existing code syntax/style
		- if your change(s) alter(s) the UI, comment a screenshot of it taken from desktop, AND a screenshot of it taken from mobile, to demonstrate design and responsiveness adherence to the app
		- double check and test changes before committing
		- keep the "Allow edits from maintainers" checkbox checked to allow maintainer pushes to your PR branch
	- don't mistake criticism of code for criticism of character. i am highly committed to quality and structure, and i try to get straight to the point with any concerns
	- if your PR isn't accepted, it probably does not align with my vision of the project. do not take offense, we all have different opinions. you are always free to maintain a fork with your changes
	- any code accepted into this project may be adapted into other works in the future. if your code is used, you will be co-authored in the commit
